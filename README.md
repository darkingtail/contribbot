# contribbot

> /kənˈtrɪbɒt/ — contrib + bot, the "b" in "contrib" merges with "bot"

[中文](README.zh.md) | English

Open source collaboration assistant. Helps developers efficiently maintain and contribute to open source projects.

MCP tools + skills — todo management, upstream tracking, issue/PR workflows, multi-project oversight.

## Prerequisites

- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) — authenticated (`gh auth login`)

## Install

### Claude Code

```bash
# Step 1: Add marketplace (first time only)
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/darkingtail/contribbot

# Step 2: Install
claude plugin install contribbot
```

This installs skills + MCP server (`contribbot-mcp`). Skills provide guided workflows, MCP server provides the tools.

### Other Platforms

contribbot's MCP server works with any MCP-compatible tool. See [Other Platforms Setup](docs/platforms.md) for Claude Desktop, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.

## What contribbot does for you

Most AI coding tools can read GitHub issues and create PRs. contribbot goes further — it tracks **what you're working on**, **what changed upstream**, and **who's doing what** across multi-maintainer repos.

### vs GitHub CLI alone

### Skills

Skills are guided workflows that orchestrate MCP tools. In Claude Code, trigger them by name or natural language.

| Skill                        | Description                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `contribbot:project-onboard` | New project setup — detect fork/upstream, init config, first sync      |
| `contribbot:daily-sync`      | Daily check — sync fork, fetch upstream commits, skip noise, triage    |
| `contribbot:start-task`      | Start working — pick todo, activate, LLM generates implementation plan |
| `contribbot:todo`            | Todo lifecycle — add, activate, claim, update, done, archive, compact  |
| `contribbot:issue`           | Issue management — list, detail, create, close, comment                |
| `contribbot:pr`              | PR management — list, summary, create, update, review, reply           |
| `contribbot:pre-submit`      | Pre-merge check — PR review, CI status, security alerts                |
| `contribbot:weekly-review`   | Weekly retrospective — contribution stats, progress, cleanup           |
| `contribbot:fork-triage`     | Fork cherry-pick decisions for downstream consumers                    |
| `contribbot:dashboard`       | Project overview — single or cross-project                             |

## Project Modes

contribbot auto-detects your project's relationship with upstream repos and adapts its workflow accordingly.

| Mode              | Condition             | What It Enables                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **none**          | No fork, no upstream  | Issue/PR/todo management          |
| **fork**          | Has fork source       | Fork sync + cherry-pick decisions |
| **upstream**      | Has external upstream | Cross-stack commit tracking       |
| **fork+upstream** | Both                  | Fork sync + cross-stack tracking  |

Run `/contribbot:project-onboard` to auto-detect and configure.

### Why fork data is stored under parent repo

When you work on `darkingtail/plane` (a fork of `makeplane/plane`), contribbot stores data under `~/.contribbot/makeplane/plane/` — the **parent repo** path.

Why: multiple people may fork the same repo. Storing under the parent ensures everyone's local data aligns to the same canonical repo, and `sync_fork` / `upstream_daily` always know which repo is the source of truth.

Your fork is recorded in `config.yaml` as the `fork` field:

```yaml
# ~/.contribbot/makeplane/plane/config.yaml
role: admin
org: null
fork: darkingtail/plane # your fork
upstream: null
```

### Three-layer capability

| Layer                | Capability                                 | Modes                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Basic                | Issue/PR/todo management                   | All                     |
| Fork tracking        | Cherry-pick decisions from fork source     | fork, fork+upstream     |
| Cross-stack tracking | Feature parity tracking across tech stacks | upstream, fork+upstream |

## Data Storage

All data is local in `~/.contribbot/{owner}/{repo}/`:

```

## Tool Architecture

Tools organized in three layers:

```
tools/
├── core/      contribbot unique (todo, upstream, knowledge, config)
├── linkage/   GitHub ops + local data sync (issue_create, pr_create...)
└── compat/    GitHub API wrappers for standalone use
```

- **Core** — Cannot be replaced by GitHub MCP. Todo management, upstream tracking, knowledge, repo config, compact.
- **Linkage** — GitHub operations that also update local data (e.g., `issue_create` auto-creates a todo).
- **Compat** — Pure GitHub API wrappers. Ensures contribbot works without GitHub MCP installed.

Full tool reference: [docs/tools.md](docs/tools.md)

## Customization

### Templates

Templates are auto-generated with documentation on first use. Edit them to customize:

- `templates/todo_record.md` — Todo implementation document format
  - Variables: `{{title}}`, `{{ref}}`, `{{type}}`, `{{date}}`
- `templates/todo_claim.md` — GitHub claim comment format
  - Variables: `{{items}}`, `{{user}}`, `{{repo}}`, `{{issue}}`

### Archive & Compact

Archived data accumulates over time. Use `todo_compact` / `upstream_compact` to clean up — by date or count. See [docs/tools.md](docs/tools.md) for details.

### Config

`config.yaml` is auto-detected on first use via `repo_config`. Fields:

| Field      | Description                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `role`     | Your GitHub permission level (auto-detected)    |
| `org`      | Organization name (auto-detected)               |
| `fork`     | Your fork repo, if this is a parent repo        |
| `upstream` | External upstream repo for cross-stack tracking |
